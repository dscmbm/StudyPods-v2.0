## About StudyPods v2.0

Study pods is an initiative taken by DSC MBM to promote peer-to-peer learning among the students with a notion that says “Learn Together, Build Together”.The program is designed to offer participants a good exposure of technology and the technical world. It is an approx one month-long program that connects like-minded participants interested in a particular domain to come together, learn together and then build together. StudyPod mentors assist participants with the roadmap, resources, take weekly updates and solve doubts which cannot be solved by the team members. At the end of the program each StudyPod needs to submit a project or a propsal for a paper that showcases their learnings during the program.

### Project 1 :Credit Card Fraud Detection System using Machine learning model's

The challenge was to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

<h3> Main challenges involved in credit card fraud detection are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.</li>
<li>Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones</li>
<li>Data availability as the data is mostly private.</li>
<li>Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported.</li>
<li>Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers.</li>
</ol>
</br>
<h3> How I tackled these challenges?</h3>
<ol>
<li>The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Imbalance can be dealt with by properly using some methods which i will talk about in the next paragraph</li>
<li>For protecting the privacy of the user the dimensionality of the data can be reduced.</li>
<li>A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-check the data, at least for training the model.</li>
<li>We can make the model simple and interpretable so that when the scammer adapts to it with just some tweaks we can have a new model up and running to deploy.</li>
</ol>

<h3> Used Random Forest model to solve the problem.</h3>
